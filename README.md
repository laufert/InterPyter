# InterPyter
Simple Interpreter, written in Python

It can be used to interpret simple inline mathematic extressions. Results can be stored in variables. Variabels can also be used for further calcuations. 

By defining the variables from extern into the Interpreter-class (InterPyter) one can use Numpy-arrays to perforem mathematics on all Array elements.
